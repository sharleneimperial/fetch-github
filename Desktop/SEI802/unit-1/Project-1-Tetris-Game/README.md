# Sharlene's Game of Tetris
Project 1 

## Technical Requirements
*Technical Requirements
Your app must:
* Display a game in the browser
* Switch turns between two players, or have the user play the computer (AI or obstacles)
* Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it**
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Concept
I wanted to create my own version of a Tetris game. When I was young, that's pretty much what I enjoyed playing on the Nintendo Game Boy.

## Music 
When you hit the Start/Pause button, the game starts and main Tetris song (from the original game) starts to play.

## Instructions
The aim in Tetris is pretty simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning(just keep pressing down on the Arrow Down key, multiple times). Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.

## How To Play
* Move Left - Arrow LEFT key
* Move Right - Arrow RIGHT key
* Move Down - Arrow DOWN key
* To Rotate Tetro Pieces - Arrow UP key

## Blockers
Yes, I did come across some minor bugs, but it is what makes coding so fun and yet challenging at the same time.
